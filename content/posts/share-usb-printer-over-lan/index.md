I was in the market for a printer that was cheap to buy and cheap to run. I did not print in color, so I concluded that a ~~dot matrix~~ laser printer would be a good choice.
I looked up a couple of units and decided on Brother DCP-1510 as it was on sale for ~$100 with replacement toners running for $8 apiece. Not a bad deal. It had one caveat - no ethernet port, no WiFi support, and no [Internet Printing Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Printing_Protocol).

That did not put me off. I have never been printing much and could live with the cable. I also knew I could attach it to a print server such as [CUPS](http://www.cups.org/) and add networking capabilities to the network-impaired printer. I had a Raspberry Pi Zero sitting around, and I wouldn't hesitate to use it. This post is a story about the journey I experienced setting it up.

# The driver support or lack thereof

I flashed [Arch Linux ARM](http://archlinuxarm.org/) onto my RPi and went driver hunting. It turned out the manufacturer does not support the ARM architecture.

After a couple of [DDG](https://ddg.gg) searches, I found [brlaser](https://github.com/pdewacht/brlaser) - a community-driven Brother driver. 
Perfect! I installed CUPS, compiled the driver, and shared the printer over the network.

{{< figure src="./images/drivers.png" alt="brlaser driver appearing in the driver selection in CUPS" align=center title="Brlaser as seen in the driver selection prompt." >}}

I clicked the _Print_ button.

# Why does it take 45 seconds to print a single {{< rawhtml >}}<attr title="I just learned this is an interrobang">pageâ€½</attr>{{< /rawhtml >}}

My eyes turned towards the printer anticipating the first sheet of paper to appear quickly, but nothing happened. Not until I tried to ssh into the Pi and started debugging. After a couple of seconds I began to hear the _brrr_ printer noise while it was spitting out the page. I tried to print a second one as I thought it needed some priming, but it also took well over half a minute.

I clicked _Print_ again and began observing the CUPS interface. It took 30 s to get through the _Processing Page_ state. Something was off.

As it turns out, Raspberry Pi Zero is not that powerful. The driver uses `ghostscript` which pegged the CPU usage to 100%. Back to the drawing board.

# Can I share an arbitrary USB device over the network? Sure I can!

I wasn't aware of the _RAW_ queue mode in CUPS at the time, but I heard about [usbip](http://usbip.sourceforge.net/), which sounded like a compelling solution to the problem, or so I thought.

I followed a great [Arch Wiki tutorial on usbip](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/USB/IP) and sure enough, I had my printer attached.

The need to load a kernel module was a bit unsettling, but I installed the drivers and configured the printer using CUPS successfully.

I hit _Print_ and almost immediately had the page handy. Whoa, that was easier than expected!

## It's not all roses ðŸŒ¹

I rebooted my laptop the next day and tried to print again, a real document this time.

It wouldn't work - the device was gone - I couldn't detach the device, I couldn't attach a new one, I tried reloading the kernel module, and it wouldn't work either, nada.

At that point, I concluded I'm not in favor of running a kernel module that's misbehaving 
I also had some security concerns around the whole architecture and therefore I uninstalled it.

# Learning about RAW queues

I came back to the problem after a couple of days, but now I had a powerful tool under my belt: knowledge about CUPS RAW queues.

A RAW queue is

{{< blockquote link="https://wiki.debian.org/CUPSPrintQueues" >}}
[...] a queue where the filtering system is not involved and the print job goes directly to a printer or another queue: 
{{< /blockquote >}}


This seemed promising for my use case. The idea was to set up a RAW queue on the Pi and then do the heavy lifting (filtering) on significantly more powerful user machines.

```goat
.----------------.         .--------------.        .---------.
|       PC       |         | Raspberry PI |        .         .
|   (filtering)  +-------->|  (raw queue) +------->| Printer |
| (brlaser + gs) |         |(no filtering)|        '         .
'----------------'         '--------------'        '---------'

```

I quickly compiled this setup and it worked out perfectly.

Note: CUPS plans to deprecate drivers and raw queues in the future because of how wide-spread IPP has become. I don't consider this to be a big issue, you can always pin the CUPS version. There's still a ton of old hardware out there, and that won't change quickly (and doesn't have to).

# The SD card gives up

After a few weeks, the SD card running the CUPS server gave up. 
I bought a new one and tried to quickly reinstall everything, but [Arch Linux ARM abandoned armv6 architecture](https://archlinuxarm.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=15721) in the meantime. I decided to use [Raspberry Pi OS](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/operating-systems/) and automate the setup.


# Automating the build process

I like to have my infrastructure defined in code and I maintain a number of Ansible playbooks and Terraform workspaces to control my servers.

[Packer](https://packer.io) seemed like the perfect tool for the job.
I have never used it before and wanted to get familiar with the tool.
It doesn't come with ARM support out of the box, but [there are two community projects to fill that niche](https://www.packer.io/docs/builders/community-supported).

I tried the [packer-builder-arm](https://github.com/mkaczanowski/packer-builder-arm/) first, but it couldn't run my Ansible playbook due to [a bug](https://github.com/mkaczanowski/packer-builder-arm/issues/169). I applied a patch but quickly ran into other issues.

At that point, I decided to use [packer-plugin-arm-image](https://github.com/solo-io/packer-plugin-arm-image) instead. The setup did not work out of the box, but after a [simple PR](https://github.com/solo-io/packer-plugin-arm-image/pull/132), it built my first empty image and proved it's possible to build an ARM image locally.

## Defining goals

I wanted an end-to-end setup with the following functionality:

- OS installation (Raspberry Pi OS)
- WiFi setup
- Autodiscovery via mDNS & DNSSD
- CUPS installation
- Printer configuration

I developed two Ansible playbooks to accomplish that. I will skip the technicalities and maybe write about the details another time.

## Run it yourself!

The final solution with a comprehensive README can be found under the [maciekmm/printer-rpi-image github repo](https://github.com/maciekmm/printer-rpi-image). 

Building, flashing, and running the image yourself is as simple as running:

```bash
# build the base image
WIFI_SSID=<SSID> WIFI_PASSWORD=<PASSWORD> SSH_PUBLIC_KEY=$(cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub) vagrant up
# flash the image onto the sd card
dd bs=4M if=./output-raspberry_pi_os.img of=<sdcarddevice> && sync
# NOTE: this runs on the live Pi. Connect it first with printers attached!
# configure the printer and firewalls
ansible-playbook -i hosts live.yaml
```

What's left is configuring the driver and discovering the printer locally. This can be done by installing CUPS locally and running through the wizard.

# Closing thoughts

I accomplished several things:

- I made my wired printer wireless,
- I learned how to use Packer,
- I learned a bit about CUPS queues,
- I published [an open source project](https://github.com/maciekmm/printer-rpi-image) for you to be able to do the same.

Overall, this was an interesting project and I'm happy to share this story.
